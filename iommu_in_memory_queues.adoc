== In-memory queue interface
Software and IOMMU interact using 3 in-memory queue data structures.

* A command-queue (`CQ`) used by software to queue commands to the IOMMU.

* A fault/event queue (`FQ`) used by IOMMU to bring faults and events to
  software's attention.

* A page-request queue (`PQ`) used by IOMMU to report “Page Request” messages
  received from PCIe devices. This queue is supported if the IOMMU supports
  PCIe cite:[PCI] defined Page Request Interface.

....
Each queue is a circular buffer with a head controlled by the consumer of data
from the queue and a tail controlled by the producer of data into the queue.
IOMMU is the producer of records into `PQ` and `FQ` and controls the tail register.
IOMMU is the consumer of commands produced by software into the CQ and controls
the head register. The tail register holds the index into the queue where the
next entry will be written by the producer. The head register holds the index
into the queue where the consumer will read the next entry to process.

A queue is empty if the head is equal to the tail. A queue is full if the tail
is the head minus one. The head and tail wrap around when they reach the end of
the circular buffer.

The producer of data must ensure that the data written to a queue and the
tail update are ordered such that the consumer that observes an update to the
tail register must also observe all data produced into the queue between the
offsets determined by the head and the tail.

[NOTE]
====
All RISC-V IOMMU implementations are required to support in-memory queues
located in main memory. Supporting in-memory queues in I/O memory is not required
but is not prohibited by this specification.
====


=== Command-Queue (CQ)

Command queue is used by software to queue commands to be processed by the
IOMMU. Each command is 16 bytes.

The PPN of the base of this in-memory queue and the size of the queue is
configured into a memory-mapped register called command-queue base (`cqb`).

The tail of the command-queue resides in a software-controlled read/write
memory-mapped register called command-queue tail (`cqt`). The `cqt` is an
index into the next command queue entry that software will write. Subsequent
to writing the command(s), software advances the `cqt` by the count of the
number of commands written.

The head of the command-queue resides in a read-only memory-mapped IOMMU
controlled register called command-queue head (`cqh`). The `cqh` is an index
into the command queue that IOMMU should process next. Subsequent to reading
each command the IOMMU may advance the `cqh` by 1. If `cqh` == `cqt`, the
command-queue is empty. If `cqt` == (`cqh` - 1) the command-queue is full.

When an error bit or the `fence_w_ip` bit  in `cqcsr` is 1, the command-queue
interrupt pending (`cip`) bit is set in the `ipsr` if interrupts from
command-queue are enabled (i.e. `cqcsr.cie` is 1).

IOMMU commands are grouped into a major command group determined by the `opcode`
and within each group the `func3` field specifies the function invoked by that
command. The `opcode` defines the format of the operand fields. One or more of
those fields may be used by the specific function invoked. The `opcode`
encodings 64 to 127 are designated for custom use.

  {bits: 118, name: 'operands'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace:1024, fontsize: 16}}
....

The commands are interpreted as two 64-bit doublewords. The byte order of each
of the doublewords in memory, little-endian or big-endian, is the endianness as
determined by `fctl.BE` (<<FCTRL>>).

The following command opcodes are defined:

| Reserved | 5-63     | Reserved for future standard use.
| Custom   | 64-127   | Designated for custom use.
|===

All undefined functions of command opcodes 0 through 63 are reserved for
future standard use.

A command is determined to be illegal if it uses a reserved encoding or if a
reserved bit is set to 1. A command is unsupported if it is defined but not
implemented as determined by the IOMMU `capabilities` register. If an illegal or
unsupported command is fetched and decoded by the command-queue then the
command-queue sets the `cqcsr.cmd_ill` bit and stops processing commands from
the command-queue. To re-enable command processing software should clear the
`cmd_ill` bit by writing 1 to it.

IOMMU operations cause implicit reads to PDT, first-stage and second-stage page
tables. To reduce latency of such reads, the IOMMU may cache entries from the
first-stage and/or second-stage page tables in the
IOMMU-address-translation-cache (IOATC). These caches might not observe
modifications performed by software to these data structures in memory.

The IOMMU translation-table cache invalidation commands, `IOTINVAL.VMA` and
`IOTINVAL.GVMA` synchronize updates to in-memory first-stage and second-stage
page table data structures respectively with the operation of the IOMMU and
invalidate the matching IOATC entries.

The `GV` operand indicates if the Guest-Soft-Context ID (`GSCID`) operand is
valid. The `PSCV` operand indicates if the Process Soft-Context ID (`PSCID`)
operand is valid. Setting `PSCV` to 1 is allowed only for `IOTINVAL.VMA`. The
`AV` operand indicates if the address (`ADDR`) operand is valid. When `GV` is 0,
the translations associated with the host (i.e. those where the second-stage
is Bare) are operated on. When `GV` is 0, the `GSCID` operand is ignored.
When `AV` is 0, the `ADDR` operand is ignored. When `PSCV` operand is 0, the
`PSCID` operand is ignored.

`IOTINVAL.VMA` ensures that previous stores made to the first-stage page
tables by the harts are observed by the IOMMU before all subsequent implicit
reads from IOMMU to the corresponding first-stage page tables.

`IOTINVAL.GVMA` ensures that previous stores made to the second-stage page

|===

[NOTE]
====
Conceptually, an implementation might contain two address-translation caches:
one that maps guest virtual addresses to guest physical addresses, and another
that maps guest physical addresses to supervisor physical addresses.
`IOTINVAL.GVMA` need not invalidate the former cache, but it must invalidate
entries from the latter cache that match the `IOTINVAL.GVMA` address and
`GSCID` operands.

More commonly, implementations contain address-translation caches that map
guest virtual addresses directly to supervisor physical addresses, removing a
level of indirection. For such implementations, any entry whose guest virtual
address maps to a guest physical address that matches the `IOTINVAL.GVMA`
address and `GSCID` arguments must be invalidated. Selectively invalidating
entries in this fashion requires tagging them with the guest physical address,
which is costly, and so a common technique is to invalidate all entries that
match the `GSCID` argument, regardless of the address argument.

Simpler implementations may ignore the operand of `IOTINVAL.VMA` and/or
`IOTINVAL.GVMA` and always perform a global invalidation of all
address-translation entries.

Some implementations may cache an identity-mapped translation for the stage of
address translation operating in `Bare` mode. Since these identity mappings
are invariably correct, an explicit invalidation is unnecessary.
====

[NOTE]
====
A consequence of this specification is that an implementation may use any
translation for an address that was valid at any time since the most recent
`IOTINVAL` that subsumes that address. In particular, if a leaf PTE is
modified but a subsuming `IOTINVAL` is not executed, either the old translation
or the new translation will be used, but the choice is unpredictable. The
behavior is otherwise well-defined.

In a conventional TLB design, it is possible for multiple entries to match a
single address if, for example, a page is upgraded to a larger page without
first clearing the original non-leaf PTE’s valid bit and executing an
`IOTINVAL.VMA` or `IOTINVAL.GVMA` as applicable with `AV=0`. In this case, a
similar remark applies: it is unpredictable whether the old non-leaf PTE or
the new leaf PTE is used, but the behavior is otherwise well defined.

Another consequence of this specification is that it is generally unsafe to
update a PTE using a set of stores of a width less than the width of the PTE,
as it is legal for the implementation to read the PTE at any time, including
when only some of the partial stores have taken effect.

], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024, fontsize:12}}
....

The IOMMU fetches commands from the CQ in order but the IOMMU may execute the
fetched commands out of order. The IOMMU advancing `cqh` is not a guarantee
that the commands fetched by the IOMMU have been executed or committed.

A `IOFENCE.C` command completion, as determined by `cqh` advancing past the
index of the `IOFENCE.C` command in the CQ, guarantees that all previous
commands fetched from the CQ have been completed and committed.

If the `IOFENCE.C` times out waiting on completion of previous commands that are
specified to have a timeout, then the `cmd_to` bit in `cqcsr` <<CSR>> is set to
signal this condition. The `cqh` holds the index of the `IOFENCE.C` that timed
out and all previous commands that are not specified to have a timeout have been
completed and committed.

[NOTE]
====
In this version of the specification, only the `ATS.INVAL` command is specified
to have a timeout.
====

The commands may be used to order memory accesses from I/O devices connected to
the IOMMU as viewed by the IOMMU, other RISC-V harts, and external devices or
co-processors.

The `PR` bit, when set to 1, can be used to request that the IOMMU ensure
that all previous read requests from devices that have already been processed
by the IOMMU be committed to a global ordering point such that they can be
observed by all RISC-V harts and IOMMUs in the system.

The `PW` bit, when set to 1, can be used to request that the IOMMU ensure
that all previous write requests from devices that have already been processed
by the IOMMU be committed to a global ordering point such that they can be
observed by all RISC-V harts and IOMMUs in the system.

The wire-signaled-interrupts (`WSI`) bit when set to 1 causes a wired-interrupt
from the command queue to be generated (by setting `cqcsr.fence_w_ip` - <<CSR>>)
on completion of `IOFENCE.C`. This bit is reserved if the IOMMU does not support
wired-interrupts or wired-interrupts have not been enabled
(i.e., `fctl.WSI == 0`).

[NOTE]
====
Software should ensure that all previous read and writes processed by the IOMMU
have been committed to a global ordering point before reclaiming memory that was
previously made accessible to a device. A safe sequence for such memory
reclamation is to first update the page tables to disallow access to the memory
from the device and then use the `IOTINVAL.VMA` or `IOTINVAL.GVMA` appropriately
to synchronize the IOMMU with the update to the page table. As part of the
synchronization if the memory reclaimed was previously made read accessible to
the device then request ordering of all previous reads; else if the memory
reclaimed was previously made write accessible to the device then request
ordering of all previous reads and writes. Ordering previous reads may be
required if the reclaimed memory will be used to hold data that must not be made
visible to the device.

The `IOFENCE.C` with `PR` and/or `PW` set to 1 only ensures that requests that
have been already processed by the IOMMU are committed to the global ordering
point. Software must perform an interconnect-specific fence action if there
is a need to ensure that all in-flight requests from a device that have not yet
been processed by the IOMMU are observed. For PCIe, for example, a completion
from device in response to a read from the device memory has the property of
ensuring that previous posted writes are observed by the IOMMU as completions
may not pass previous posted writes.

The ordering guarantees are made for accesses to main-memory. For accesses to
I/O memory, the ordering guarantees are implementation and I/O protocol
defined.

Simpler implementations may unconditionally order all previous memory accesses
globally.
====

The `AV` command operand indicates if `ADDR[63:2]` operand and `DATA` operands are
valid. If `AV`=1, the IOMMU writes `DATA` to memory at a 4-byte aligned address
`ADDR[63:2] * 4` as a 4-byte store when the command completes. When `AV` is 0,
the `ADDR[63:2]` and `DATA` operands are ignored.

[NOTE]
====
Software may configure the `ADDR[63:2]` command operand to specify the address
of the `seteipnum_le`/`seteipnum_be` register in an IMSIC to cause an external
interrupt notification on `IOFENCE.C` completion. Alternatively, software may
program `ADDR[63:2]` to a memory location and use `IOFENCE.C` to set a flag in
memory indicating command completion.

IOMMU operations cause implicit reads to DDT and/or PDT. To reduce latency of
such reads, the IOMMU may cache entries from the DDT and/or PDT in IOMMU
directory caches. These caches might not observe modifications performed by
software to these data structures in memory.

[[IDDT]]

The IOMMU DDT cache invalidation command, `IODIR.INVAL_DDT`, synchronizes updates
to DDT with the operation of the IOMMU and flushes the matching cached entries.

[[IPDT]]

The IOMMU PDT cache invalidation command, `IODIR.INVAL_PDT`, synchronizes updates
to PDT with the operation of the IOMMU and flushes the matching cached entries.

The `DV` operand indicates if the device ID (`DID`) operand is valid. The `DV`
operand must be 1 for `IODIR.INVAL_PDT` else the command is illegal. When `DV`
operand is 1, the value of the `DID` operand must not be wider than that
supported by the `ddtp.iommu_mode`.

`IODIR.INVAL_DDT` guarantees that any previous stores made by a RISC-V hart to
the DDT are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from IOMMU to DDT.
If `DV` is 0, then the command invalidates all  DDT and PDT entries cached for
all devices; the `DID` operand is ignored. If `DV` is 1, then the command
invalidates cached leaf-level DDT entry for the device identified by `DID`
operand and all associated PDT entries. The `PID` operand is reserved for the
`IODIR.INVAL_DDT` command.

`IODIR.INVAL_PDT` guarantees that any previous stores made by a RISC-V hart to
the PDT are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from IOMMU to PDT.
The command invalidates cached leaf PDT entry for the specified `PID` and `DID`.
The `PID` operand of `IODIR.INVAL_PDT` must not be wider than the width
supported by the IOMMU (see <<CAP>>).

[NOTE]
====
Some fields in the Device-context or Process-context may be guest-physical
addresses. An implementation when caching the device-context or process-context
may cache these fields after translating them to a supervisor physical address.
Other implementations may cache them as guest-physical addresses and
translate them to supervisor physical addresses using a second-stage page table
just prior to accessing memory referenced by these addresses.

If second-stage page tables used for these translations are modified, software
must issue the appropriate `IODIR` command as some implementations may choose to
cache the translated supervisor physical address pointer in the IOMMU directory
caches.

The `IOTINVAL` command has no effect on the IOMMU directory caches.

==== IOMMU PCIe ATS commands

This command is supported if `capabilities.ATS` is set to 1.

[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 7, name: 'opcode', attr: 'ATS(0x4)'},
  {bits: 3, name: 'func3',  attr: ['INVAL-0x0', 'PRGR-0x1']},
  {bits: 2, name: 'rsvd'},
  {bits: 20, name: 'PID'},
  {bits: 1, name: 'PV'},
  {bits: 1, name: 'DSV'},
  {bits: 6, name: 'rsvd'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'RID'},
  {bits: 8, name: 'DSEG'},
  {bits: 64, name: 'PAYLOAD'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024, fontsize:12}}
....
The `ATS.INVAL` command instructs the IOMMU to send an “Invalidation Request”
message to the PCIe device function identified by `RID`. An
“Invalidation Request” message is used to clear a specific subset of the
address range from the address translation cache in a device function. The
`ATS.INVAL` command completes when an “Invalidation Completion” response message
is received from the device or a protocol-defined timeout occurs while waiting
for a response. The IOMMU may advance the `cqh` and fetch more commands from
CQ while a response is awaited. If a timeout occurs, it is reported when a
subsequent `IOFENCE.C` command is executed.

[NOTE]
====
Software that needs to know if the invalidation operation completed on the
device may use the IOMMU command-queue fence command (`IOFENCE.C`) to wait for
the responses to all prior “Invalidation Request” messages. The `IOFENCE.C` is
guaranteed to not complete before all previously fetched commands were executed
and completed. A previously fetched ATS command to invalidate device ATC does
not complete until either the request times out or a valid response is received
from the device.

If one or more ATS invalidation commands preceding the `IOFENCE.C` have timed
out, then software may make the CQ operational again and resubmit the
invalidation commands that may have timed out. If the `ATS.INVAL` commands
queued before the `IOFENCE.C` were directed at multiple devices then software
may resubmit these commands as `ATS.INVAL` and `IOFENCE.C` pairs to identify
the device that caused the timeout.
====

The `ATS.PRGR` command instructs the IOMMU to send a “Page Request Group
Response” message to the PCIe device function identified by the `RID`. The
“Page Request Group Response” message is used by system hardware and/or
software to communicate with the device functions page-request interface to
signal completion of a “Page Request”, or the catastrophic failure of the
interface.

If the `PV` operand is set to 1, the message is generated with a PASID with the
PASID field set to the `PID` operand. if `PV` operand is set to 0, then the
`PID` operand is ignored and the message is generated without a PASID.

The `PAYLOAD` operand of the command is used to form the message body and its
fields are as specified by the PCIe specification cite:[PCI]. The `PAYLOAD` field is
formatted as follows:

.`PAYLOAD` of an `ATS.INVAL` command

....

If the `DSV` operand is 1, then a valid destination segment number is specified
by the `DSEG` operand. If the `DSV` operand is 0, then the `DSEG` operand is
ignored.

A Hierarchy is a PCI Express I/O interconnect topology, wherein the
Configuration Space addresses, referred to as the tuple of Bus/Device/Function
Numbers, are unique. In some contexts, a Hierarchy is also called a Segment, and
in Flit Mode, the Segment number is sometimes included in the ID of a Function.

[[FAULT_QUEUE]]
=== Fault/Event-Queue (`FQ`)
Fault/Event queue is an in-memory queue data structure used to report events
and faults raised when processing transactions. Each fault record is 32 bytes.

The PPN of the base of this in-memory queue and the size of the queue is
configured into a memory-mapped register called fault-queue base (`fqb`).

The tail of the fault-queue resides in an IOMMU controlled read-only
memory-mapped register called `fqt`.  The `fqt` is an index into the next fault
record that IOMMU will write in the fault-queue. Subsequent to writing the
record, the IOMMU advances the `fqt` by 1. The head of the fault-queue resides
in a read/write memory-mapped software controlled register called `fqh`. The `fqh`
is an index into the fault record that SW should process next. Subsequent
to processing fault record(s) software advances the `fqh` by the count of the
number of fault records processed. If `fqh` == `fqt`, the fault-queue is empty. If
`fqt` == (`fqh` - 1) the fault-queue is full.

The fault records are interpreted as four 64-bit doublewords. The byte order of
each of the doublewords in memory, little-endian or big-endian, is the endianness
as determined by `fctl.BE` (<<FCTRL>>).

If the `TTYP` is a transaction with an IOVA then its reported in `iotval`. If
the `TTYP` is a PCIe message request then the message code is reported in `iotval`.
If `TTYP` is 0, then the value reported in `iotval` and `iotval2` fields is
as defined by the `CAUSE`.

[NOTE]
====
The `IOVA` is partitioned into a virtual page number (VPN) and page offset.
Whereas the VPN is translated into a physical page number (PPN) by the address
translation process, the page offset is not required for this process. The IO
bridge in some implementations may not provide the page offset part of the
`IOVA` to the IOMMU and the IOMMU may report the page offset in `iotval` as 0.
Likewise, an IOMMU may report the page offset of a GPA in `iotval2` as 0.
====

`DID` holds the `device_id` of the transaction. If `PV` is 0, then `PID` and
`PRIV` are 0. If `PV` is 1, the `PID` holds a `process_id` of the transaction
and if the privilege of the transaction was Supervisor then the `PRIV` bit is 1
else it's 0. The `DID`, `PV`, `PID`, and `PRIV` fields are 0 if `TTYP` is 0.

If the `CAUSE` is a guest-page fault then bits 63:2 of the zero-extended
guest-physical-address are reported in `iotval2[63:2]`. If bit 0 of `iotval2` is
1, then the guest-page-fault was caused by an implicit memory access for
first-stage address translation. If bit 0 of `iotval2` is 1, and the implicit
access was a write then bit 1 of `iotval2` is set to 1 else it is set to 0.

[NOTE]
====
The bit 1 of `iotval2` is set for the case where the implementation supports
hardware updating of A/D bits and the implicit memory access was attempted to
automatically update A and/or D in first-stage page tables. All other implicit
memory accesses for first-stage address translation will be reads. If the
hardware updating of A/D bits is not implemented, the _write_ case will never
arise.

When the second-stage is not Bare, the memory accesses for reading PDT entries to
locate the Process-context are implicit memory accesses for first-stage address
translation. If a guest-page fault was caused by implicit memory access to read
PDT entries, then bit 0 of `iotval2` is reported as 1 and bit 1 as 0.
====

The IOMMU may be unable to report faults through the fault-queue due to error
conditions such as the fault-queue being full or the IOMMU encountering access
faults when attempting to access the queue memory. A memory-mapped fault
control and status register (`fqcsr`) holds information about such faults. If
the fault-queue full condition is detected, the IOMMU sets the fault-queue overflow
(`fqof`) bit in fqcsr. If the IOMMU encounters a fault in accessing the
fault-queue memory, the IOMMU sets the fault-queue memory access fault (`fqmf`)
bit in `fqcsr`. While either error bit is set in `fqcsr`, the IOMMU discards
the record that led to the fault and all further fault records. When an error
bit in `fqcsr` is 1 or when a new fault record is produced in the fault-queue,
the fault interrupt pending (`fip`) bit is set in the `ipsr` if interrupts from
the fault-queue are enabled i.e. `fqcsr.fie` is 1.

The IOMMU may identify multiple requests as having detected an identical fault.
In such cases the IOMMU may report each of those faults individually, or report
the fault for a subset, including one, of requests.

[[PRQ]]
=== Page-Request-Queue (`PQ`)
Page-request queue is an in-memory queue data structure used to report PCIe
ATS “Page Request” and "Stop Marker" messages cite:[PCI] to software. The base PPN of
this in-memory queue and the size of the queue is configured into a
memory-mapped register called page-request queue base (`pqb`).
Each Page-Request record is 16 bytes.

The tail of the queue resides in an IOMMU controlled read-only memory-mapped
register called `pqt`.  The `pqt` holds an index into the queue where the next
page-request message will be written by the IOMMU. Subsequent to writing the
message, the IOMMU advances the `pqt` by 1.

The head of the queue resides in a software controlled read/write memory-mapped
register called `pqh`. The `pqh` holds an index into the queue where the next
page-request message will be received by software. Subsequent to processing the
message(s) software advances the `pqh` by the count of the number of messages
processed.

If `pqh` == `pqt`, the page-request queue is empty.

If `pqt` == (`pqh` - 1) the page-request queue is full.

The IOMMU may be unable to report "Page Request" messages through the queue due
to error conditions such as the queue being disabled, queue being full, or the
IOMMU encountering access faults when attempting to access queue memory. A
memory-mapped page-request queue control and status register (`pqcsr`) is used
to hold information about such faults.  On a page queue full condition the
page-request-queue overflow (`pqof`) bit is set in `pqcsr`. If the IOMMU
encountered a fault in accessing the queue memory, the page-request-queue memory
access fault (`pqmf`) bit is set in `pqcsr`. While either error bit is set in
`pqcsr`, the IOMMU discards all subsequent "Page Request" messages, including
the message that caused the error bits to be set. "Page request" messages that
do not require a response, i.e. those with the "Last Request in PRG" field is 0,
are silently discarded. "Page request" messages that require a response, i.e.
those with "Last Request in PRG" field set to 1 and are not "Stop Marker"
messages, may be auto-completed by an IOMMU generated “Page Request Group
Response” message as specified in <<ATS_PRI>>.

When an error bit in `pqcsr` is 1 or when a new message is produced in the
queue, the page-request-queue interrupt pending (`pip`) bit is set in the `ipsr` if
interrupts from page-request-queue are enabled i.e. `pqcsr.pie` is 1.

The `DID` field holds the requester ID from the message. The `PID` field is
valid if `PV` is 1 and reports the PASID from message. `PRIV` is set to 0 if the
message did not have a PASID, otherwise it holds the “Privilege Mode Requested”
bit from the TLP. The `EXEC` bit is set to 0 if the message did not have a PASID,
otherwise it reports the “Execute Requested” bit from the TLP. All other fields
are set to 0. The payload of the “Page Request” message (bytes 0x08 through 0x0F
of the message) is held in the `PAYLOAD` field. If `R` and `W` are both 0 and
`L` is 1, the message is "Stop Marker".

The page-request-queue records are interpreted as two 64-bit doublewords. The byte
order of each of the doublewords in memory, little-endian or big-endian, is the
endianness as determined by `fctl.BE` (<<FCTRL>>).

The `PAYLOAD` holds the message body and its fields are as specified by the PCIe
specification cite:[PCI]. The `PAYLOAD` field is formatted as follows:
