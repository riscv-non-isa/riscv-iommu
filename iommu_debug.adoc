== Debug support
To support software debug, the IOMMU may provide an optional register interface
that may be used by software to request IOMMU to perform an address translation.
The IOMMU supports this capability when `capabilities.DBG` is 1. The interface
consists of two set of registers; translation-request registers that are used by
software to program an IOVA and other inputs needed by the process to
translate an IOVA (<<P2IOVA>>) as an Untranslated Request. The result of the
translation, if the process completes successfully, is reported through the
translation-response registers. If the process stops due to faults then the
faults are reported normally in the fault-queue and the translation-response
registers updated with a failure indicator. If the IOVA is determined to be
that of a virtual interrupt file (<<MSI_ID>>) and the corresponding MSI PTE is
in MRIF mode, then the process stops and reports a "Transaction type disallowed"
(cause = 260) fault.

When the process to translate an IOVA is invoked for this purpose, the IOMMU
may not cache first-stage PTEs, second-stage PTEs, DDT entries, PDT entries, or
MSI PTEs accessed for the translation process in the IOATC. The IOMMU is allowed
to use any PTEs or directory structure entries that may already be cached in the
IOATC. The IOMMU may update the Accessed (A) and/or Dirty (D) bits in the PTEs
used for the translation process if supported by the IOMMU. When the IOMMU
implements a HPM, the HPM counters may be updated normally by the IOMMU. For the
purpose of counting in the HPM, these requests are treated as Untranslated
Requests.

The translation-request interface consists of the following 64-bit WARL registers:

* `tr_req_iova` (<<TRR_IOVA>>)
* `tr_req_ctl` (<<TRR_CTRL>>)

The translation-response interface consists of a single 64-bit RO register
`tr_response` (<<TRR_RSP>>)

To request a translation, the `tr_req_iova` register is written first with
the desired IOVA and the `tr_req_ctl` register is written next. The 'Go/Busy`
bit is set in `tr_req_ctl` to indicate a valid request in the registers.  The
`Go/Busy` bit is a read-write-sticky (RWS) bit that once set cannot be cleared
by writing the register. The `Go/Busy` bit will be cleared to 0 by the IOMMU
when the process completes (successfully or due to encountering a fault). When
the `Go/Busy` bit goes from 1 to 0, a response is valid in the `tr_response`
register.

The IOMMU behavior is `UNSPECIFIED` if:

* The `tr_req_iova` or `tr_req_ctl` are modified when the `Go/Busy` bit is 1.
* IOMMU configurations such as `ddtp.iommu_mode`, etc. are modified.

The time to complete a translation request through this debug interface is
`UNSPECIFIED` but is required to be finite. If the IOMMU is serving translation
requests from the IO bridge when a request is made through this register
interface then the time to complete the request may be longer than when the
IOMMU is otherwise idle.

[NOTE]
====
The debug interface is optional but recommended to be implemented to aid
software debug and to implement architectural compliance tests.
