== Introduction
The Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU), sometimes referred to as a
System MMU (SMMU), is a system-level Memory Management Unit (MMU) that connects
direct-memory-access-capable Input/Output (I/O) devices to system memory.

For each I/O device connected to the system through an IOMMU, software can
configure at the IOMMU a device context, which associates with the device a
specific virtual address space and other per-device parameters. By giving
each device its own separate device context at an IOMMU, each device can be
individually configured for a separate operating system, which may be a guest OS
or the main (host) OS. On every memory access initiated by a device, the IOMMU
identifies the originating device by some form of unique device
identifier, which the IOMMU then uses to locate the appropriate device context
within data structures supplied by software. For PCIe cite:[PCI], for example,
the originating device may be identified by the unique 16-bit triplet of PCI bus
number (8-bit), device number (5-bit), and function number (3-bit) (collectively
known as routing identifier or RID) and optionally up to 8-bit segment number
when the IOMMU supports multiple Hierarchies. This specification refers to such
unique device identifier as `device_id` and supports up to 24-bit wide
identifiers.

[NOTE]
====
A Hierarchy is a PCI Express I/O interconnect topology, wherein the
Configuration Space addresses, referred to as the tuple of Bus/Device/Function
Numbers, are unique. In some contexts, a Hierarchy is also called a Segment, and
in Flit Mode, the Segment number is sometimes included in the ID of a Function.
====

Some devices may support shared virtual addressing which is the ability to
share process address spaces with devices. Sharing process address spaces with
devices allows to rely on core kernel memory management for DMA, removing some
complexity from application and device drivers. After binding to a device,
applications can instruct it to perform DMA on statically or dynamically
allocated buffers. To support such addressing, software can configure one or
more process contexts into the device context. Every memory access initiated
by such a device is accompanied by a unique process identifier, which the IOMMU
uses in conjunction with the unique device identifier to locate the appropriate
process context configured by software in the device context. For PCIe, for
example, the process context may be identified by the unique 20-bit process
address space identifier (PASID). This specification refers to such unique
process identifiers as `process_id` and supports up to 20-bit wide identifiers.

The IOMMU employs a two-stage address translation process to translate the IOVA
to an SPA and to enforce memory protections for the DMA. To perform address
translation and memory protection the IOMMU uses same page table formats as used
by the CPU's MMU for the first-stage and second-stage address translation. Using
the same page table formats as the CPUâ€™s MMU removes some of the memory
management complexity for DMA. Use of an identical format also allows the same
page tables to be used simultaneously by both the CPU MMU and the IOMMU.

Although there is no option to disable two-stage address translation, either
stage may be effectively disabled by configuring the virtual memory scheme for
that stage to be `Bare` i.e. perform no address translation or memory protection.

<<<

The virtual memory scheme employed by the IOMMU may be configured individually
per device in the IOMMU. Devices perform DMA using an I/O virtual address (IOVA).
Depending on the virtual memory scheme selected for a device, the IOVA used by
the device may be a supervisor physical address (SPA), guest physical address
(GPA), or a virtual address (VA).

If the virtual memory scheme selected for both stages is `Bare` then the IOVA is
a SPA. There is no address translation or protection performed by the IOMMU.

If the virtual memory scheme selected for first-stage is `Bare` but the scheme
for the second-stage is not `Bare` then the IOVA is a GPA. The first-stage is
effectively disabled. The second-stage translates the GPA to SPA and enforces the configured
memory protections. Such a configuration would be typically employed when the
device control is passed through to a virtual machine but the Guest OS in the VM
does not use first-stage address translation to further constrain memory accesses
from such devices. Comparing to a RISC-V hart, this configuration is analogous
to two-stage address translation being in effect on a RISC-V hart with the
G-stage active and the VS-stage set to Bare.

If the virtual memory scheme selected for first-stage is not `Bare` but the
scheme for the second-stage is `Bare` then IOVA is a VA. The second-stage is
effectively disabled. The first-stage translates the VA to a SPA and enforces the configured
memory protections. This configuration would be typically employed when the
IOMMU is used by a native OS or when the control of the device is retained by
the hypervisor itself. Comparing to a RISC-V hart, this configuration is
analogous to single-stage address translation being in effect on a RISC-V hart.

If the virtual memory scheme selected for neither stage is `Bare` then the IOVA
is a VA. Two-stage address translation is in effect. The first-stage translates
the VA to a GPA and the second-stage translates the GPA to a SPA. Each stage
enforces the configured memory protections. Such a configuration would be
typically be employed when the device control is passed-through to a virtual
machine and the Guest OS in the VM uses the first-stage address translation to
further constrain the memory accessed by such devices and associated privileges
and memory protections. Comparing to a RISC-V hart, this configuration is
analogous to two-stage address translation being in effect on a RISC-V hart with
both G-stage and VS-stage active (not Bare).

DMA address translation in the IOMMU has certain performance implications for
DMA accesses as the access time may be lengthened by the time required to
determine the SPA using the software provided data structures.
Similar overheads in the CPU MMU are mitigated typically through the use of a
translation look-aside buffer (TLB) to cache these address translations such
that they may be re-used to reduce the translation overhead on subsequent
accesses. The IOMMU may employ similar address translation caches, referred as
IOMMU Address Translation Cache (IOATC). The IOMMU provides mechanisms for
software to synchronize the IOATC with the memory resident data structures used
for address translation when they are modified. Software may configure the
device context with a software defined context identifier called guest
soft-context identifier (`GSCID`) to indicate that a collection of devices are
assigned to the same VM and thus access a common virtual address space.
Software may configure the process context with a software defined context
identifier called process soft-context identifier (`PSCID`) to identify a
collection of processes that share a common virtual address space.
The IOMMU may use the `GSCID` and `PSCID` to tag entries in the IOATC to avoid
duplication and simplify invalidation operations.

<<<

Some devices may participate in the translation process and provide a device
side ATC (DevATC) for its own memory accesses. By providing a DevATC, the
device shares the translation caching responsibility and thereby reduce
probability of "thrashing" in the IOATC. The DevATC may be sized by the device
to suit its unique performance requirements and may also be used by the device
to optimize DMA latency by prefetching translations. Such mechanisms require
close cooperation of the device and the IOMMU using a protocol. For PCIe, for
example, the Address Translation Services (ATS) protocol may be used by the
device to request translations to cache in the DevATC and to synchronize it
with updates made by software address translation data structures. The
device participating in the address translation process also enables the use
of I/O page faults to avoid the core kernel memory manager from having to make
all physical memory that may be accessed by the device resident at all times.
For PCIe, for example, the device may implement the Page Request Interface (PRI)
to dynamically request the memory manager to make a page resident if it
discovers the page for which it requested a translation was not available. An
IOMMU may support specialized software interfaces and protocols with the device
to enable services such as PCIe ATS and PCIe PRI cite:[PCI].

In systems built with an Incoming Message-Signaled Interrupt Controller (IMSIC),
the IOMMU may be programmed by the hypervisor to direct message-signaled
interrupts (MSI) from devices controlled by the guest OS to a guest interrupt
file in an IMSIC. Because MSIs from devices are simply memory writes, they
would naturally be subject to the same address translation that an IOMMU
applies to other memory writes. However, the RISC-V Advanced Interrupt
Architecture cite:[AIA] requires that IOMMUs treat MSIs directed to virtual
machines specially, in part to simplify software, and in part to allow optional
support for memory-resident interrupt files. The device context is configured by
software with parameters to identify memory accesses to a virtual interrupt file
and to be translated using a MSI address translation table configured by software
in the device context.

=== Usage models


==== Non-virtualized OS

A non-virtualized OS may use the IOMMU for the following significant system-level
functionalities:

. Protect the operating system from bad memory accesses from errant devices
. Support 32-bit devices in 64-bit environment (avoidance of bounce buffers)
. Support mapping of contiguous virtual addresses to an underlying fragmented
  physical addresses (avoidance of scatter/gather lists)
. Support shared virtual addressing

In the absence of an IOMMU a device could access any memory, such as privileged
memory, and cause malicious or unintended corruptions. This may be due to
hardware bugs, device driver bugs, or due to malicious software/hardware.

The IOMMU offers a mechanism for the OS to defend against such unintended
corruptions by limiting the memory that can be accessed by devices.  As depicted
in <<fig:device-isolation>> the OS may configure the IOMMU with a page table to
translate the IOVA and thereby limit the addresses that may be accessed to those
allowed by the page table.

Legacy 32-bit devices cannot access the memory above 4 GiB. The IOMMU, through
its address remapping capability, offers a simple mechanism for the device to
directly access any address in the system (with appropriate access permission).
Without an IOMMU, the OS must resort to copying data through buffers (also
known as bounce buffers) allocated in memory below 4 GiB. In this scenario the
IOMMU improves the system performance.

The IOMMU can be useful to perform scatter/gather DMA as it permits to allocate
large regions of memory for I/O without the need for all of the memory to be
contiguous. A contiguous virtual address range can map to such fragmented
physical addresses and the device programmed with the virtual address range.

The IOMMU can be used to support shared virtual addressing which is the ability
to share a process address space with devices. The virtual addresses used for
DMA are then translated by the IOMMU to an SPA.

When the IOMMU is used by a non-virtualized OS, the first-stage suffices to
provide the required address translation and protection function and the
second-stage may be set to Bare.

==== Hypervisor

IOMMU makes it possible for a guest operating system, running in a virtual
machine, to be given direct control of an I/O device with only minimal
hypervisor intervention.

A guest OS with direct control of a device will program the device with guest
physical addresses, because that is all the OS knows. When the device then
performs memory accesses using those addresses, an IOMMU is responsible for
translating those guest physical addresses into supervisor physical addresses,
referencing address-translation data structures supplied by the hypervisor.

<<fig:dma-translation-direct-device-assignment>> illustrates the concept. 
The device D1 is directly assigned to VM-1 and device D2 is directly assigned
to VM-2. The VMM configures a second-stage page table to be used for each device
and restricts the memory that can be accessed by D1 to VM-1 associated memory
and from D2 to VM-2 associated memory.

To handle MSIs from a device controlled by a guest OS, the hypervisor configures
an IOMMU to redirect those MSIs to a guest interrupt file in an IMSIC
(see <<MSI_REDIR>>) or to a memory-resident interrupt file. The IOMMU is
responsible to use the MSI address-translation data structures supplied by the
hypervisor to perform the MSI redirection. Because every interrupt file, real or
virtual, occupies a naturally aligned 4-KiB page of address space, the required
address translation is from a virtual (guest) page address to a physical page
address, the same as supported by regular RISC-V page-based address translation.

==== Guest OS

The hypervisor may provide a virtual IOMMU facility, through hardware
emulation or by enlightening the guest OS to use a software interface with
the Hypervisor (also known as para-virtualization). The guest OS may then use
the facilities provided by the virtual IOMMU to avail the same benefits as
those discussed for a non-virtualized OS through the use of a first-stage page
table that it controls. The hypervisor establishes a second-stage page table
that it controls to virtualize the address space for the virtual machine and to
contain memory accesses from the devices passed through to the VM to the memory
associated with the VM.

With two-stage address translations active, the IOVA is first translated to
a GPA using the first-stage page tables managed by the guest OS and the GPA
translated to a SPA using the second-stage page tables managed by the
hypervisor.

<<fig:iommu-for-guest-os>> illustrates the concept.

The IOMMU is configured to perform address translation using a first-stage
and second-stage page table for device D1. The second-stage is typically used by
the hypervisor to translate GPA to SPA and limit the device D1 to memory
associated with VM-1. The first-stage is typically configured by the Guest OS to
translate a VA to a GPA and contain device D1 access to a subset of VM-1 memory.

For device D2 only the second-stage is active and the first-stage is set to Bare.

The host OS or hypervisor may also retain a device, such as D3, for its own use.
The first-stage suffices to provide the required address translation and
protection function for device D3 and the second-stage is set to Bare.

=== Placement and data flow

<<fig:example-soc-with-iommu>> shows an example of a typical system on a chip
(SOC) with RISC-V hart(s). The SOC incorporates memory controllers and several
IO devices. This SOC also incorporates two instances of the IOMMU. A device
may be directly connected to the IO Bridge and the system interconnect or may
be connected through a Root Port when a IO protocol transaction to system
interconnect transaction translation is required. In case of PCIe cite:[PCI],
for example, the Root Port is a PCIe port that maps a portion of a hierarchy
through an associated virtual PCI-PCI bridge and maps the PCIe IO protocol
transactions to the system interconnect transactions.

[[fig:example-soc-with-iommu]]
.Example of IOMMUs integration in SoC.
image::placement.svg[width=800, align="center"]

The first IOMMU instance, IOMMU 0 (associated with the IO Bridge 0), interfaces
a Root Port to the system fabric/interconnect. One or more endpoint devices are
interfaced to the SoC through this Root Port. In the case of PCIe, the Root Port
incorporates an ATS interface to the IOMMU that is used to support the PCIe ATS
protocol by the IOMMU.  The example shows an endpoint device with a device side
ATC (DevATC) that holds translations obtained by the device from IOMMU 0 using
the PCIe ATS protocol cite:[PCI].

When such IO-protocol-to-system-fabric-protocol translation using a Root Port
is not required, the devices may interface directly with the system fabric.
The second IOMMU instance, IOMMU 1 (associated with the IO Bridge 1),
illustrates interfacing devices (IO Devices A and B) to the system fabric
without the use of a Root Port.

The IO Bridge is placed between the device(s) and the system interconnect to
process DMA transactions. IO Devices may perform DMA transactions using IO
Virtual Addresses (VA, GVA or GPA). The IO Bridge invokes the associated IOMMU
to translate the IOVA to a Supervisor Physical Addresses (SPA).

The IOMMU is not invoked for outbound transactions.

The IOMMU is invoked by the IO Bridge for address translation and protection for
inbound transactions. The data associated with the inbound transactions is not
processed by the IOMMU. The IOMMU behaves like a look-aside IP to the IO Bridge
and has several interfaces (see <<fig:iommu-interfaces>>):

* Host interface: it is an interface to the IOMMU for the harts to access
  its memory-mapped registers and perform global configuration and/or
  maintenance operations.
* Device Translation Request interface: it is an interface, which receives
  the translation requests from the IO Bridge. On this interface the IO Bridge
  provides information about the request such as:
.. The hardware identities associated with transaction - the `device_id` and
   if applicable the `process_id` and its validity. The IOMMU uses the hardware
   identities to retrieve the context information to perform the requested
   address translations.
.. The IOVA and the type of the transaction (Translated or Untranslated).
.. Whether the request is for a read, write, execute, or an atomic operation.
... Execute requested must be explicitly associated with the request
    (e.g., using a PCIe PASID). When not explicitly requested, the default must
    be 0.
.. The privilege mode associated with the request. When a privilege mode is not
   explicitly associated with the request (e.g., using a PCIe PASID), the default
   privilege mode must be User. For requests without a `process_id` the privilege
   mode must be User.
.. The number of bytes accessed by the request.
.. The IO Bridge may also provide some additional opaque information (e.g. tags)
   that are not interpreted by the IOMMU but returned along with the response
   from the IOMMU to the IO Bridge. As the IOMMU is allowed to complete
   translation requests out of order, such information may be used by the IO
   Bridge to correlate completions to previous requests.
* Data Structure interface: it is used by the IOMMU for implicit access to
  memory. It is a requester interface to the IO Bridge and is used to fetch the
  required data structure from main memory. This interface is used to access:
.. The device and process directories to get the context information and
   translation rules.
.. The first-stage and/or second-stage page table entries to translate the IOVA.
.. The in-memory queues (command-queue, fault-queue, and page-request-queue)
   used to interface with software.
* Device Translation Completion interface: it is an interface which
  provides the completion response from the IOMMU for previously requested
  address translations. The completion interface may provide information
  such as:
.. The status of the request, indicating if the request completed successfully
   or a fault occurred.
.. If the request was completed successfully; the Supervisor Physical Address
   (SPA).
.. Opaque information (e.g. tags), if applicable, associated with the request.
.. The page-based memory types (PBMT), if Svpbmt is supported, obtained from the
   IOMMU address translation page tables. The IOMMU provides the page-based
   memory type as resolved between the first-stage and second-stage page table
   entries.
* ATS interface: The ATS interface, if the optional PCIe ATS capability is
  supported by the IOMMU, is used to communicate with ATS capable endpoints
  through the PCIe Root Port. This interface is used:
.. To receive ATS translation requests from the endpoints and to return the
   completions to the endpoints. The Root Port may provide an indication if the
   endpoint originating the request is a CXL type 1 or type 2 device.
.. To send ATS "Invalidation Request" messages to the endpoints and to receive
   the "Invalidation Completion" messages from the endpoints.
.. To receive "Page Request" and "Stop Marker" messages from the endpoints and
   to send "Page Request Group Response" messages to the endpoints.

The interfaces related to recording an incoming MSI in a memory-resident
interrupt file (MRIF) (See RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture cite:[AIA])
are implementation-specific. The partitioning of responsibility between
the IOMMU and the IO bridge for recording the incoming MSI in an MRIF and
generating the associated _notice_ MSI are implementation-specific.

Similar to the RISC-V harts, physical memory attributes (PMA) and physical
memory protection (PMP) checks must be completed on all inbound IO transactions
even when the IOMMU is in bypass (`Bare` mode). The placement and integration of
the PMA and PMP checkers is a platform choice.

PMA and PMP checkers reside outside the IOMMU. The example above is showing
them in the IO Bridge.

Implicit accesses by the IOMMU itself through the Data Structure interface are
checked by the PMA checker. PMAs are tightly tied to a given physical platformâ€™s
organization, and many details are inherently platform-specific.

The memory accesses performed by the IOMMU using the Data Structure interface
need not be ordered in general with the device-initiated memory accesses.

[NOTE]
====
The IOMMU may generate implicit memory accesses on the Data Structure interface
to access data structures needed to perform the address translations. Such
accesses must not be blocked by the original device-initiated memory access.

The IO bridge may perform ordering of memory accesses on the Data Structure
interface to satisfy the necessary hazard checks and other rules as defined by
the IO bridge and the system interconnect.
====

The IOMMU provides the resolved PBMT (PMA, IO, NC) along with the translated
address on the device translation completion interface to the IO Bridge. The
PMA checker in the IO Bridge may use the provided PBMT to override the PMA(s)
for the associated memory pages.

The PMP checker may use the hardware ID of the bus access initiator to determine
physical memory access privileges. As the IOMMU itself is a bus access initiator
for its implicit accesses, the IOMMU hardware ID may be used by the PMP checker
to select the appropriate access control rules.

[NOTE]
====
The IOMMU does not validate the authenticity of the hardware IDs provided by
the IO bridge.

The IO bridge and/or the root ports must include suitable mechanisms to
authenticate the hardware IDs. In some SOCs this may be trivially achieved as a
property of the devices being integrated into the SOC and their IDs being
immutable. For PCIe, for example, the PCIe defined Access Control Services (ACS)
Source Validation capabilities may be used to authenticate the hardware IDs.
Other implementation-specific methods in the IO bridge may be provided to
perform such authentication.
