== Introduction
The Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU), sometimes referred to as a
System MMU (SMMU), is a system-level Memory Management Unit (MMU) that connects
direct-memory-access-capable Input/Output (I/O) devices to system memory.

For each I/O device connected to the system through an IOMMU, software can
configure at the IOMMU a device context, which associates with the device a
specific virtual address space and other per-device parameters. By giving
each device its own separate device context at an IOMMU, each device can be
individually configured for a different software master, usually a guest OS or
the main (host) OS. On every memory access made from a device, hardware
indicates to the IOMMU the originating device by some form of unique device
identifier, which the IOMMU uses to locate the appropriate device context
within data structures supplied by software. For PCIe cite:[PCI], for example,
the originating device may be identified by the unique 16-bit triplet of PCI bus
number (8-bit), device number (5-bit), and function number (3-bit)
(collectively known as routing identifier or RID) and optionally up to 8-bit 
segment number when the IOMMU supports multiple Hierarchies. This specification
refers to such unique device identifier as `device_id` and supports up to 
24-bit wide identifiers.

[NOTE]
====
A Hierarchy is a PCI Express I/O interconnect topology, wherein the
Configuration Space addresses, referred to as the tuple of Bus/Device/Function
Numbers, are unique. In some contexts, a Hierarchy is also called a Segment, and
in Flit Mode, the Segment number is sometimes included in the ID of a Function.

Some devices may support shared virtual addressing which is the ability to
share process address spaces with devices. Sharing process address spaces with
devices allows to rely on core kernel memory management for DMA, removing some
complexity from application and device drivers. After binding to a device,
applications can instruct it to perform DMA on application statically or 
dynamically allocated buffers. To support such addressing, software can 
configure one or more process contexts into the device context. On every memory
access made from a device, the hardware indicates to the IOMMU a unique process
identifier, which the IOMMU uses in conjunction with the unique device 
identifier to locate the appropriate process context configured by software in
the device context. For PCIe, for example, the process context may be identified
by the unique 20-bit process address space identifier (PASID). This 
specification refers to such unique process identifiers as `process_id` and 
supports up to 20-bit wide identifiers.

Using the same S/VS-stage and G-stage page table formats in IOMMU for address
translation and protections as the CPUâ€™s MMU removes some complexity from the
core kernel memory management for DMA. Use of an identical format also allows
the same G and S/VS-stage tables to be used by both MMU and the IOMMU.

DMA address translation in the IOMMU has certain performance implications for
DMA accesses as DMA access time may be lengthened due to the time required to
resolve the supervisor physical address using software provided data structures.
Similar overheads in the CPU MMU are mitigated typically through the use of a
translation look-aside buffer (TLB) to cache these address translations such
that they may be re-used to reduce the translation overhead on subsequent
accesses. The IOMMU may employ similar address translation caches, referred as
IOMMU Address Translation Cache (IOATC). The IOMMU provides mechanisms for
software to synchronize the IOATC with the memory resident data structures used
for address translation when they are modified. Software may configure the
device context with a software defined context identifier called guest 
soft-context identifier (`GSCID`) to indicate that a collection of devices are
assigned to the same VM and thus access a common virtual address space. 
Software may configure the process context with a software defined context
identifier called process soft-context identifier (`PSCID`) to identify a 
collection of process identifier that share a common virtual address space.
The IOMMU may use the `GSCID` and `PSCID` to tag entries in the IOATC to avoid
duplication and simplify invalidation operations.

Some devices may participate in the translation process and provide a device
side ATC (DevATC) for its own memory accesses. By providing a DevATC, the
device shares the translation caching responsibility and thereby reduce
probability of "thrashing" in the IOATC. The DevATC may be sized by the device
to suit its unique performance requirements and may also be used by the device
to optimize latency by prefetching translations. Such mechanisms require
close cooperation of the device and the IOMMU using a protocol. For PCIe, for
example, the Address Translation Services (ATS) protocol may be used by the
device to request translations to cache in the DevATC and to synchronize it
with updates made by software address translation data structures. The
device participating in the address translation process also enables the use
of I/O page faults to avoid the core kernel memory manager from having to make
all physical memory that may be accessed by the device resident at all times.
For PCIe, for example, the device may implement the Page Request Interface (PRI)
to dynamically request the memory manager to make a page resident if it
discovers the page for which it requested a translation was not available. An
IOMMU may support specialized software interfaces and protocols with the device
to enable services such as PCIe ATS and PCIe PRI.

In systems built with an Incoming Message-Signaled Interrupt Controller (IMSIC),
the IOMMU may be programmed by the hypervisor to direct message-signaled
interrupts (MSI) from devices controlled by the guest OS to a guest interrupt
file in an IMSIC. Because MSIs from devices are simply memory writes, they
would naturally be subject to the same address translation that an IOMMU
applies to other memory writes. However, the Advanced Interrupt Architecture
cite:[RISCV-AIA] requires that IOMMUs treat MSIs directed to virtual machines
specially, in part to simplify software, and in part to allow optional support
for memory-resident interrupt files. The device context is configured by
software with parameters to identify memory accesses to a virtual interrupt
file and to be translated using a MSI address translation table configured by
software in the device context.

=== Usage models


==== Non-virtualized OS

A non-virtualized OS may use the IOMMU for the following significant system-level
functionalities:

. Protect the operating system from bad memory accesses from errant devices
. Support 32-bit devices in 64-bit environment (avoidance of bounce buffers)
. Support mapping of contiguous virtual addresses to an underlying fragmented
  physical addresses (avoidance of scatter/gather lists)
. Dynamic redirection of interrupts
. Support shared virtual addressing

In the absence of an IOMMU, a device driver must program devices with Physical
Addresses, which implies that DMA from a device could be used to access
any memory, such as privileged memory, and cause malicious or unintended
corruptions. This may be caused by hardware bugs, device driver bugs, or
by malicious software/hardware.

The IOMMU offers a mechanism for the OS to defend against such unintended
corruptions by limiting the memory that can be accessed by devices using DMA.
Indeed, as depicted in <<fig:device-isolation>> diagram the Operating System 
configures the IOMMU to use the S-stage page table to translate IOVA to SPA and
thereby limit the addresses that may be accessed.

Legacy 32-bit devices cannot access the memory above 4 GiB. The integration of
the IOMMU, through its address remapping capability, offers a simple mechanism
for the DMA to directly access any address in the system (with appropriate access
 permission). Without an IOMMU, the OS must resort to copying data through
buffers (also known as bounce buffers) allocated in memory below 4 GiB.
In this scenario the IOMMU improves the system performance.

The IOMMU can be useful as it permits to allocate large regions of memory
without the need to be contiguous in physical memory. Indeed, a contiguous
virtual address range can be mapped to a fragmented physical addresses.

The IOMMU can be used to support shared virtual addressing which is the ability
to share process address space with devices. Sharing process address spaces with
devices allows to rely on core kernel memory management for DMA, removing some
complexity from application and device drivers.

Please in ditaa figures don't use the minus key '-' in your keyboard when
typing text (like 'non-privileged' in the figure below).
'-' is a special character that is used by ditaa to draw lines, not text.

Note that in your editor both probably look the same, but when rendered by
ditaa/asciidoc the '-' from your keyboard is used to draw a line, while the

==== Hypervisor

IOMMU makes it possible for a guest operating system, running in a virtual
machine, to be given direct control of an I/O device with only minimal
hypervisor intervention.

A guest OS with direct control of a device will program the device with guest
physical addresses, because that is all the OS knows. When the device then
performs memory accesses using those addresses, an IOMMU is responsible for
translating those guest physical addresses into supervisor physical addresses,
referencing address-translation data structures supplied by the hypervisor.

<<fig:dma-translation-direct-device-assignment>> diagram illustrates the concept. The device D1 is directly
assigned to VM-1 and device D2 is directly assigned to VM-2. The VMM configures
the G-stage page table to be used by each device and restricts the memory
that can be accessed by D1 to VM-1 associated memory and from D2 to VM-2
associated memory.

....

To handle MSIs from a device controlled by a guest OS, the hypervisor configures
an IOMMU to redirect those MSIs to a guest interrupt file in an IMSIC (see <<MSI_REDIR>>) or to a
memory-resident interrupt file. The IOMMU is responsible to use the MSI
address-translation data structures supplied by the hypervisor to perform the
MSI redirection. Because every interrupt file, real or virtual, occupies a
naturally aligned 4-KiB page of address space, the required address translation
is from a virtual (guest) page address to a physical page address, the same as
supported by regular RISC-V page-based address translation.

==== Guest OS

The presence of an IOMMU allows each device to be individually configured
for a different software master, usually a guest OS or the main (host) OS.

On implementations of the IOMMU that support two stages of translation (VS-stage
and G-stage), the G-stage translation (or second stage of translation) is
intended to virtualize device DMA to the guest OS physical address space. Devices
can be assigned to guest OS which can directly program the device to do DMA with
its Guest Physical Addresses (GPA). The hypervisor or host OS will set up and
configure the IOMMU to perform GPA to PA translation using G-stage page tables.
The use of the G-stage page tables limits the physical memory accessible by a
device controlled by the guest OS to the memory allocated to its virtual machine.

The hypervisor may then provide a virtual IOMMU facility, through hardware
emulation or by enlightening the guest OS to use a software interface with
the Hypervisor (also known as para-virtualization). The guest OS may then
use the facilities provided by the virtual IOMMU to avail the same benefits
as those discussed for a non-virtualized OS. The guest OS employs a page table,
really a VS-stage page table, to perform similar configurations for the device in a
non-virtualized OS.

With two-stage address translations enabled, the IOVA may be first translated to
a GPA using the VS-stage page tables managed by the guest OS and the GPA
translated to a SPA using the G-stage page tables managed by the hypervisor.

<<fig:iommu-for-guest-os>> diagram illustrates the concept. The IOMMU is configured to
perform two-stage address translation (VS-stage and G-stage) for
device D1 and to perform G-stage only translation for
device D2. The host OS or hypervisor may also retain a device, such as D3, for
its own use and configure the IOMMU to perform a single-stage (S-stage)
translation.

The hypervisor may use the MSI address translation capability to dynamically
redirect interrupts from guest controlled devices to the guest assigned
interrupt register file of an IMSIC in the RISC-V hart.

=== Placement and data flow

<<fig:example-soc-with-iommu>> shows an example of a typical system on a chip
(SOC) with RISC-V hart(s). The SOC incorporates memory controllers and several
IO devices. This SOC also incorporates two instances of the IOMMU. The device
may be directly connected to the IO Bridge and the system interconnect or may
be connected through a Root Port when a IO protocol transaction to system
interconnect transaction translation is required. In case of PCIe, for example,
the Root Port is a PCIe port that maps a portion of a hierarchy through an
associated virtual PCI-PCI bridge and maps the PCIe IO protocol transactions
to the system interconnect transactions.

The first instance, IOMMU 0 (associated with the IO Bridge 0), interfaces a
Root Port to the system fabric/interconnect. One or more endpoint devices are
interface to the SoC through this Root Port. In case of PCIe, the Root Port
incorporates an ATS interface to the IOMMU that is used to support the PCIe
ATS protocol cite:[PCI] by the IOMMU.  The example shows an endpoint device
with a device side ATC (DevATC) that holds translations obtained by the device
from IOMMU 0 using the PCIe ATS protocol.

When such IO protocol to system fabric protocol translation using a Root Port
is not required, the devices may interface directly with the system fabric.
The second instance, IOMMU 1 (associated with the IO Bridge 1), illustrates
interfacing devices (IO Devices A and B) to the system fabric without the use
of a Root Port.

The IO Bridge is placed between the device(s) and the system interconnect to 
process device originated DMA transactions. IO Devices may perform DMA 
transactions using IO Virtual Addresses (VA, GVA or GPA). The IO Bridge 
invokes the associated IOMMU to translate the IOVA to a Supervisor Physical 
Addresses (SPA).

The IOMMU is not invoked for outbound transactions.

The IOMMU is invoked by the IO Bridge for address translation and protection for
inbound transactions. The data associated with the inbound transactions is not
processed by the IOMMU. The IOMMU behaves like a look-aside IP to the IO Bridge
and has several interfaces (see <<fig:iommu-interfaces>>):

* Host interface: it is a slave interface to the IOMMU for the harts to access
  its memory-mapped registers and perform global configuration and/or maintenance
  operations.
* Device Translation Request interface: it is a slave interface, which receives
  the translation requests from the IO Bridge. On this interface the IO Bridge
  provides information about the request such as:
.. The hardware identities associated with transaction - the `device_id` and
   if applicable the `process_id` and its validity. The IOMMU uses the hardware
   identities to retrieve the context information to perform the requested
   address translations.
.. The IOVA and the type of the transaction (Translated or Untranslated).
.. Whether the request is for a read, write, execute, or an atomic operation.
... Execute requested must be explicitly associated with the request
    (e.g., using a PCIe PASID). When not explicitly requested, the default must
    be 0.
.. The privilege mode associated with the request. When a privilege mode is not
   explicitly associated with the request (e.g., using a PCIe PASID), the default
   privilege mode must be User.
.. The number of bytes accessed by the request.
.. The IO Bridge may also provide some additional opaque information (e.g. tags)
   that are not interpreted by the IOMMU but returned along with the response
   from the IOMMU to the IO Bridge. As the IOMMU is allowed to complete
   translation requests out of order, such information may be used by the IO
   Bridge to correlate completions to previous requests.
* Data Structure interface: it is used by the IOMMU for implicit access to
  memory. It is a master interface to the IO Bridge and is used to fetch the
  required data structure from main memory. This interface is used to access:
.. The device and process directories to get the context information and
   translation rules.
.. The G-stage and/or S/VS-stage page table entries to translate the IOVA.
.. The in-memory queues (command-queue, fault-queue, and page-request-queue)
   used to interface with software.
* Device Translation Completion interface: it is a master interface which
  provides the completion response from the IOMMU for previously requested
  address translations. The completion interface may provide information
  such as:
.. The status of the request, indicating if the request completed successfully
   or a fault occurred.
.. If the request was completed successfully; the Supervisor Physical Address (SPA).
.. Opaque information (e.g. tags), if applicable, associated with the request.
.. The page-based memory types (PBMT), if Svpbmt is supported, obtained from the
   IOMMU address translation page tables. When two-stage address translation is
   performed the IOMMU provides the page-based memory type as resolved between
   the G-stage and VS-stage page table entries.
* ATS interface: The ATS interface, if the optional PCIe ATS cite:[PCI] capability is
  supported by the IOMMU, is used to communicate with ATS capable endpoints
  through the PCIe Root Port. This interface is used to:
.. To receive ATS translation requests from the endpoints and to return the
   completions to the endpoints. The Root Port may provide an indication if the
   endpoint originating the request is a CXL type 1 or type 2 device.
.. To send ATS "Invalidation Request" messages to the endpoints and to receive
   the "Invalidation Completion" messages from the endpoints.
.. To receive "Page Request" and "Stop Marker" messages from the endpoints and
   to send "Page Request Group Response" messages to the endpoints.

Similar to the RISC-V harts, physical memory attributes (PMA) and physical memory
protection (PMP) checks must be completed on any inbound IO transactions even when
the IOMMU is in bypass (bare state). The placement and integration of the PMA and
PMP checkers is a platform choice.

PMA and PMP checkers reside outside the IOMMU. The example above is showing
them in the IO Bridge.

Implicit accesses by the IOMMU itself through the Data Structure interface are
checked by the PMA checker. PMAs are tightly tied to a given physical platformâ€™s
organization, many details are inherently platform-specific.

The memory accesses performed by the IOMMU using the Data Structure interface
need not be ordered in general with the device initiated memory accesses.

[NOTE]
====
IOMMU may generate implicit memory accesses on the Data Structure interface to
access data structures needed to perform the address translations. Such accesses
must not be blocked by the original device initiated memory access.

IO bridge may perform ordering of memory accesses on the Data Structure interface
to satisfy the necessary hazard checks and other rules as defined by the IO
bridge and the system interconnect.
====

The IOMMU provides the resolved PBMT (PMA, IO, NC) along with the translated
address on the device translation completion interface to the IO Bridge. The
PMA in IO Bridge may use the provided PBMT to override the PMA(s) for the
associated memory pages.

The PMP may use the hardware ID of the bus master to determine physical memory
access privileges. As the IOMMU itself is a bus master for its implicit
accesses, the IOMMU hardware ID may be used by the PMP to select the appropriate
access control rules.

[NOTE]
====
The IOMMU does not validate the authenticity of the hardware IDs provided by 
the IO bridge. 

The IO bridge and/or the root ports must include suitable mechanisms to
authenticate the hardware IDs. In some SOC this may be trivially achieved as a
property of the devices being integrated into the SOC and their IDs being
immutable. For PCIe, for example, the PCIe defined Access Control Services (ACS)
Source Validation capabilities may be used to authenticate the hardware IDs.
Other implementation specific methods in the IO bridge may be provided to
perform such authentication.

  structures using hardware provide unique `process_id`. The supported
  `process_id` may be up to 20-bit.

* 16-bit GSCIDs and 20-bit PSCIDs.

* Single stage and two stage address translation.

* VS/S-stage and G-stage virtual-memory system as specified by the RISC-V
  Privileged specification cite:[PRIV] to allow software flexibility to use
  a common page table for the CPU MMU as well as the IOMMU or to use a
  separate page table for the IOMMU.

* Up to 57-bit virtual-address width, 56-bit system-physical-address, and 59-bit
  guest-physical-address width.

* Hardware updating of PTE Accessed and Dirty bits.

  translation, using MSI page tables, to redirect MSIs to interrupt files in an
  IMSIC using MSI PTEs in translate-R/W mode and redirecting MSI to
  memory-resident-interrupt-files (MRIF) using MSI PTEs in MRIF mode.

* Svnapot and Svpbmt extension.

* PCIe cite:[PCI] ATS and PRI services. Support for translating an IOVA to a
  GPA instead of a SPA in response to a translation request.

* A hardware performance monitor (HPM).
