== Software guidelines

This section provides guidelines to software developers on the correct and
expected sequence of using the IOMMU interfaces. The behavior of the IOMMU
if these guidelines are not followed is implementation defined.

=== Reading and writing IOMMU registers
Read or write access to IOMMU registers must follow the following rules:

* Address of the access must be aligned to the size of the access.
* The access must not span multiple registers.
* Registers that are 64-bit wide may be accessed using either a 32-bit or
  a 64-bit access.
* Registers that are 32-bit wide must only be accessed using a 32-bit access.

=== Guidelines for initialization

The guidelines for initializing the IOMMU are as follows:

. Read the `capabilities` register to discover the capabilities of the IOMMU.
. Stop and report failure if `capabilities.version` is not supported.
. Read the feature control register (`fctl`).
. Stop and report failure if big-endian memory access is needed and the
  `capabilities.END` field is 0 (i.e. only one endianness) and `fctl.BE` is
  0 (i.e. little endian).
. If big-endian memory access is needed and the `capabilities.END` field is 1
  (i.e. both endiannesses supported), set `fctl.BE` to 1 (i.e. big endian)
  if the field is not already 1.
. Stop and report failure if wired-signaled-interrupts are needed for IOMMU
  initiated interrupts and `capabilities.IGS` is not `WSI`.
. If wired-signaled-interrupts are needed for IOMMU initiated interrupts and
  `capabilities.IGS` is `BOTH`, set `fctl.WSI` to 1 if the field is not
  already 1.
. Stop and report failure if other required capabilities
  (e.g. virtual-addressing modes, MSI translation, etc.) are not supported.
. The `icvec` register is used to program an interrupt vector for each
  interrupt cause. Determine the number of vectors supported by the IOMMU by
  writing 0xF to each field and reading back the number of writable bits. If
  the number of writable bits is `N` then the number of supported vectors is
  `2^N^`. For each cause `C` associate a vector `V` with the cause. `V` is a
  number between 0 and `(2^N^ - 1)`.
. If the IOMMU is configured to use wired interrupts, then each vector `V`
  corresponds to an interrupt wire connected to a platform level interrupt
  controller (e.g. APLIC). Determine the interrupt controller configuration
  register to be programmed for each such wire using configuration information
  provided by configuration mechanisms such as device tree and program the
  interrupt controller.
. If the IOMMU is configured to use MSI, then each vector `V` is an index into
  the `msi_cfg_tbl`. For each vector `V`, allocate a MSI address `A` and
  an interrupt identity `D`. Configure the `msi_addr_V` register with value `A`,
  `msi_data_V` register with value `D`. Configure the interrupt mask `M` in
  `msi_vec_ctl_V` register appropriately.
. To program the command queue, first determine the number of entries `N` needed
  in the command queue. The number of entries in the command queue must be a
  power of two. Allocate a `N` x 16-bytes sized memory buffer that is naturally
  aligned to the greater of 4-KiB or `N` x 16-bytes. Let `k=log~2~(N)` and `B`
  be the physical page number (PPN) of the allocated memory buffer. Program
  the command queue registers as follows:

**  Poll on `cqcsr.busy` until it reads 0
**  `temp_cqb_var.PPN = B`
**  `temp_cqb_var.LOG2SZ-1 = (k - 1)`
**  `cqb = temp_cqb_var`
**  `cqt = 0`
**  `cqcsr.cqen = 1`
**  Poll on `cqcsr.cqon` until it reads 1

. To program the fault queue, first determine the number of entries N needed in
  the fault queue. The number of entries in the fault queue is always a power
  of two.  Allocate a `N` x 32-bytes sized memory buffer that is naturally
  aligned to the greater of 4-KiB or `N` x 32-bytes. Let `k=log~2~(N)` and `B`
  be the PPN of the allocated memory buffer. Program the fault queue registers
  as follows:

**  Poll on `fqcsr.busy` until it reads 0
**  `temp_fqb_var.PPN = B`
**  `temp_fqb_var.LOG2SZ-1 = (k - 1)`
**  `fqb = temp_fqb_var`
**  `fqh = 0`
**  `fqcsr.fqen = 1`
**  Poll on `fqcsr.fqon` until it reads 1

. To program the page-request queue, first determine the number of entries `N`
  needed in the page-request queue. The number of entries in the page-request
  queue is always a power of two. Allocate a `N` x 16-bytes sized buffer that is
  naturally aligned to the greater of 4-KiB or `N` x 16-bytes. Let `k=log~2~(N)`
  and `B` be the PPN of the allocated memory buffer. Program the page-request
  queue registers as follows:

**  Poll on `pqcsr.busy` until it reads 0
**  `temp_pqb_var.PPN = B`
**  `temp_pqb_var.LOG2SZ-1 = (k - 1)`
**  `pqb = temp_pqb_var`
**  `pqh = 0`
**  `pqcsr.pqen = 1`
**  Poll on `pqcsr.pqon` until it reads 1

. To program the DDT pointer, first determine the supported `device_id` width `Dw`
  and the format of the device-context data structure. If `capabilities.MSI` is
  0, then the IOMMU uses base-format device-contexts else extended-format
  device-contexts are used. Allocate a page (4 KiB) of memory to use as the root
  table of the DDT. Initialize the allocated memory to all 0. Let `B` be the
  PPN of the allocated memory. Determine the mode `M` of the DDT based on `Dw`
  and the IOMMU device-contexts format as follows:
** Determine the values supported by `ddtp.iommu_mode` by writing legal values
   and reading it to see if the value was retained. Stop and report a failure if
   the supported modes do not support the required `Dw`.
** If extended-format device-contexts are used then
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to  6-bits and `1LVL` is supported then `M = 1LVL`
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to 15-bits and `2LVL` is supported then `M = 2LVL`
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to 24-bits and `3LVL` is supported then `M = 3LVL`
** If base-format device-contexts are used then
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to  7-bits and `1LVL` is supported then `M = 1LVL`
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to 16-bits and `2LVL` is supported then `M = 2LVL`
.. If `Dw` is less than or equal to 24-bits and `3LVL` is supported then `M = 3LVL`

+
Program the `ddtp` register as follows:

** `temp_ddtp_var.iommu_mode = M`
** `temp_ddtp_var.PPN = B`
** `ddtp = temp_ddtp_var`

The IOMMU is initialized and may be now be configured with device-contexts
for devices in scope of the IOMMU.

=== Guidelines for invalidations
This section provides guidelines to software on the invalidation commands to
send to the IOMMU through the `CQ` when modifying the IOMMU in-memory data
structures. Software must perform the invalidation after the update is globally
visible. The ordering on stores provided by FENCE instructions and the acquire/
release bits on atomic instructions also orders the data structure updates
associated with those stores as observed by IOMMU.

A `IOFENCE.C` command may be used by software to ensure that all previous
commands fetched from the `CQ` have been completed and committed.

[[DC_CHANGE]]
==== Changing device directory table entry
If software changes a leaf-level DDT entry (i.e, a device context (`DC`), of
device with `device_id = D`) then the following invalidations must be performed:

* `IODIR.INVAL_DDT` with `DV=1` and `DID=D`
* If `DC.tc.PDTV==1` then `IODIR.INVAL_PDT` with `DV=1`, `PV=0`, and `DID=D`

* If `DC.iohgatp.MODE != Bare`
** `IOTINVAL.VMA` with `GV=1`, `AV=PSCV=0`, and `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`
** `IOTINVAL.GVMA` with `GV=1`, `AV=0`, and `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`
* else
** If `DC.tc.PDTV==1 || DC.tc.PDTV == 0 && DC.fsc.MODE == Bare`
*** `IOTINVAL.VMA` with `GV=AV=PSCV=0`
** else
*** `IOTINVAL.VMA` with `GV=AV=0` and `PSCV=1`, and `PSCID=DC.ta.PSCID`

If software changes a non-leaf-level DDT entry the following invalidations
must be performed:

* `IODIR.INVAL_DDT` with `DV=0`

Between a change to the DDT entry and when an invalidation command to invalidate
the cached entry is processed by the IOMMU, the IOMMU may use the old value or
the new value of the entry.

[[PC_CHANGE]]
==== Changing process directory table entry
If software changes a leaf-level PDT entry (i.e, a process context (`PC`), for
`device_id=D` and `process_id=P`) then the following invalidations must be
performed:

* `IODIR.INVAL_PDT` with `DV=1`, `PV=1`, `DID=D` and `PID=P`
* If `DC.iohgatp.MODE != Bare`
** `IOTINVAL.VMA` with `GV=1`, `AV=0`, `PV=1`, `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`,
   and `PSCID=PC.PSCID`
* else
** `IOTINVAL.VMA` with `GV=0`, `AV=0`, `PV=1`, and `PSCID=PC.PSCID`

Between a change to the PDT entry and when an invalidation command to invalidate
the cached entry is processed by the IOMMU, the IOMMU may use the old value or
the new value of the entry.

[[MSI_PT_CHANGE]]
==== Changing MSI page table entry
If software changes a MSI page-table entry identified by interrupt file
number `I` that corresponds to an untranslated MSI address `A` then the following
invalidations must be performed:

* `IOTINVAL.GVMA` with `GV=AV=1`, `ADDR[63:12]=A[63:12]` and
    `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`

To invalidate all cache entries from a MSI page table the following
invalidations must be performed:

* `IOTINVAL.GVMA` with `GV=1`, `AV=0`, and `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`

Between a change to the MSI PTE and when an invalidation command to invalidate
the cached PTE is processed by the IOMMU, the IOMMU may use the old PTE value
or the new PTE value.

==== Changing second-stage page table entry
If software changes a leaf second-stage page-table entry of a VM where the change
affects translation for a guest-PPN `G` then the following invalidations must be
performed:

* `IOTINVAL.GVMA` with `GV=AV=1`, `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`, and `ADDR[63:12]=G`

If software changes a non-leaf second-stage page-table entry of a VM
then the following invalidations must be performed:

* `IOTINVAL.GVMA` with `GV=1`, `AV=0`, `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID`

The `DC` has fields that hold a guest-PPN. An implementation may translate such
fields to a supervisor-PPN as part of caching the `DC`. If the second-stage page
table update affects translation of guest-PPN held in the `DC` then software
must invalidate all such cached `DC` using `IODIR.INVAL_DDT` with `DV=1` and
`DID` set to the corresponding `device_id`.  Alternatively, an
`IODIR.INVAL_DDT` with `DV=0` may be used to invalidate all cached `DC`.

Between a change to the second-stage PTE and when an invalidation command to
invalidate the cached PTE is processed by the IOMMU, the IOMMU may use the
old PTE value or the new PTE value.

==== Changing first-stage page table entry

A `DC` may be configured with a first-stage page table (when `DC.tc.PDTV=0`) or
a directory of first-stage page tables selected using `process_id` from a
process-directory-table (when `DC.tc.PDTV=1`).

When a change is made to a first-stage page table, and the second-stage is
Bare, then software must perform invalidations using `IOTINVAL.VMA` with
`GV=0` and `AV` and `PSCV` operands appropriate for the modification as
specified in <<IVMA>>.

When a change is made to a first-stage page table, and the second-stage is
not Bare, then software must perform invalidations using `IOTINVAL.VMA` with
`GV=1`, `GSCID=DC.iohgatp.GSCID` and `AV` and `PSCV` operands appropriate for
the modification as specified in <<IVMA>>.

Between a change to the first-stage PTE and when an invalidation command to
invalidate the cached PTE is processed by the IOMMU, the IOMMU may use the
old PTE value or the new PTE value.

==== Accessed (A)/Dirty (D) bit updates and page promotions

When IOMMU supports hardware-managed A and D bit updates, if software clears
the A and/or D bit in the first-stage and/or second-stage PTEs then software
must invalidate corresponding PTE entries that may be cached by the IOMMU. If
such invalidations are not performed, then the IOMMU may not set these bits
when processing subsequent transactions that use such entries.

When software upgrades a page in a first-stage PT and/or a second-stage PT to
a superpage without first clearing the original non-leaf PTE's valid bit and
invalidating cached translations in the IOMMU then it is possible for the
IOMMU to cache multiple entries that match a single address. The IOMMU may
use either the old non-leaf PTE or the new non-leaf PTE but the behavior is
otherwise well defined.

When promoting and/or demoting page sizes, software must ensure that the
original and new PTEs have identical permission and memory type attributes and
the physical address that is determined as a result of translation using either
the original or the new PTE is otherwise identical for any given input. The
only PTE update supported by the IOMMU without first clearing the V bit in the
original PTE and executing a appropriate `IOTINVAL` command is to do a page size
promotion or demotion. The behavior of the IOMMU if other attributes are
changed in this fashion is implementation defined.

==== Device Address Translation Cache invalidations

When first-stage and/or second-stage page tables are modified, invalidations may
be needed to the DevATC in the devices that may have cached translations from
the modified page tables. Invalidation of such page tables requires generating
ATS invalidations using `ATS.INVAL` command. Software must specify the `PAYLOAD`
following the rules defined in PCIe ATS specifications cite:[PCI].

If software generates ATS invalidate requests at a rate that exceeds the
average DevATC service rate then flow control mechanisms may be triggered by
the device to throttle the rate. A side effect of this is congestion
spreading to other channels and links which could lead to performance
degradation. An ATS capable device publishes the maximum number of
invalidations it can buffer before causing back-pressure through the Queue
Depth field of the ATS capability structure. When the device is virtualized
using PCIe SR-IOV, this queue depth is shared among all the VFs of the device.
Software must limit the number of outstanding ATS invalidations queued to
the device advertised limit.

The `RID` field is used to specify the routing ID of the ATS invalidation
request message destination. A PASID specific invalidation may be performed by
setting `PV=1` and specifying the PASID in `PID`. When the IOMMU supports
multiple segments then the `RID` must be qualified by the destination segment
number by setting `DSV=1` with the segment number provided in `DSEG`.

When ATS protocol is enabled for a device, the IOMMU may still cache
translations in its IOATC in addition to providing translations to the DevATC.
Software must not skip IOMMU translation cache invalidations even when ATS is
enabled in the device context of the device. Since a translation request from
the DevATC may be satisfied by the IOMMU from the IOATC, to ensure correct
operation software must first invalidate the IOATC before sending
invalidations to the DevATC.

==== Caching invalid entries

This specification does not allow the caching of first/second-stage PTEs whose
`V` (valid) bit is clear, non-leaf DDT entries whose `V` (valid) bit is clear,
Device-context whose `V` (valid) bit is clear, non-leaf PDT entries whose `V`
(valid) bit is clear, Process-context whose `V` (valid) bit is clear, or MSI
PTEs whose `V` bit is clear.

Software need not perform invalidations when changing the `V` bit in these
entries from 0 to 1.

=== Reconfiguring PMAs

Where platforms support dynamic reconfiguration of PMAs, a machine-mode driver
is usually provided that can correctly configure the platform. In some
platforms that might involve platform-specific operations and if the IOMMU
must participate in these operations then platform-specific operations in the
IOMMU are used by the machine-mode driver to perform such reconfiguration.

=== Guidelines for handling interrupts from IOMMU
IOMMU may generate an interrupt from the `CQ`, the `FQ`, the `PQ`, or the HPM. Each
interrupt source may be configured with a unique vector or a vector may be
shared among one or more interrupt sources. The interrupt may be delivered
as a MSI or a wire-signaled-interrupt. The interrupt handler may perform the
following actions:

. Read the `ipsr` register to determine the source of the pending interrupts
. If the `ipsr.cip` bit is set then an interrupt is pending from the `CQ`.
.. Read the `cqcsr` register.
.. Determine if an error caused the interrupt and if so, the cause of the
   error by examining the state of the `cmd_to`, `cmd_ill`, and `cqmf` bits.
   If any of these bits are set then the `CQ` encountered an error and command
   processing is temporarily disabled.
.. If errors have occurred, correct the cause of the error and clear the bits
   corresponding to the corrected errors in `cqcsr` by writing 1 to the bits.
... Clearing all error indication bits in `cqcsr` re-enables command processing.
.. An IOMMU that supports wired-interrupts may be requested to generate an
   interrupt from the command queue on completion of a `IOFENCE.C` command.
   This cause is indicated by the `fence_w_ip` bit. Note that command
   processing does not stop when `fence_w_ip` is set to 1. Software handler
   may re-enable interrupts from `CQ` on `IOFENCE.C` completions by clearing
   this bit by writing 1 to it.
.. Clear `ipsr.cip` by writing 1 to the bit.
. If the `ipsr.fip` bit is set then an interrupt is pending from the `FQ`.
.. Read the `fqcsr` register.
.. Determine if an error caused the interrupt and if so, the cause of the error
   by examining the state of the `fqmf` and `fqof` bits. If either of these bits
   are set then the `FQ` encountered an error and fault/event reporting is
   temporarily disabled.
.. If errors have occurred, correct the cause of the error and clear the bits
   corresponding to the corrected errors in `fqcsr` by writing 1 to the bits.
... Clearing all error indication bits in `cqcsr` re-enables fault/event
   reporting.
.. Clear `ipsr.fip` by writing 1 to the bit.
.. Read the `fqt` and `fqh` registers.
.. If value of `fqt` is not equal to value of `fqh` then the `FQ` is not empty
   and contains fault/event reports that need processing.
.. Process pending fault/event reports that need processing and remove them from
   the `FQ` by advancing the `fqh` by the number of records processed.
. If the `ipsr.pip` bit is set then an interrupt is pending from the `PQ`.
.. Read the `pqcsr`register.
.. Determine if an error caused the interrupt and if so, the cause of the error
   by examining the state of the `pqmf` and `pqof` bits. If either of these bits
   are set then the `PQ` encountered an error and "Page Request" reporting is
   temporarily disabled.
.. If errors have occurred, correct the cause of the error and clear the bits
   corresponding to the corrected errors in `pqcsr` by writing 1 to the bits.
... Clearing all error indication bits in `pqcsr` re-enables "Page Request"
   reporting.
.. Clear `ipsr.pip` by writing 1 to the bit.
.. Read the `pqt` and `pqh` registers.
.. If value of `pqt` is not equal to the value of `pqh` then the `PQ` is not empty
   and contains "Page Request" messages that need processing.
.. Process pending "Page Request" messages that need processing and remove them
   from the `PQ` by advancing the `pqh` by the number of records processed.
... Software may observe an incomplete page-request group in `PQ` when a
    overflow occurs. Software should ignore the group and not service such
    groups.
. If `ipsr.pmip` bit is set then an interrupt is pending from the HPM.
.. Clear `ipsr.pmip` by writing 1 to the bit.
.. Process the performance monitoring counter overflows.

=== Guidelines for enabling and disabling ATS and/or PRI

To enable ATS and/or PRI:

. Place the device in an idle state such that no transactions are generated
  by the device.
. If the device-context for the device is already valid then first mark the
  device-context as invalid and queue commands to the IOMMU to invalidate all
  cached first/second-stage page table entries, DDT entries, MSI PT entries
  (if required), and PDT entries (if required).
. Program the device-context with `EN_ATS` set to 1 and if required the `T2GPA`
  field set to 1. Set `EN_PRI` to 1 if required. If `EN_PRI` is set to 1 then
  set `PRPR` to 1 if required.
. Mark the device-context as valid.
. Enable device to use ATS and if required enable the PRI.

To disable ATS and/or PRI:

. Place the device in an idle state such that no transactions are generated
  by the device.
. Disable ATS and/or PRI at the device
. Set `EN_ATS` and/or `EN_PRI` to 0 in the device-context. If `EN_ATS` is set to
  0 then set `EN_PRI` and `T2GPA` to 0. If `EN_PRI` is set to 0 then set `PRPR`
  to 0. 
. Queue commands to the IOMMU to invalidate all cached first/second-stage page
  table entries, DDT entries, MSI PT entries (if required), and PDT entries
  (if required).
. Queue commands to the IOMMU to invalidate DevATC by generating Invalidation
  Request messages.
. Enable DMA operations in the device.
