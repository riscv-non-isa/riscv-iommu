== Memory-mapped register interface

The IOMMU provides a memory-mapped programming interface. The memory-mapped
registers of each IOMMU are located within a naturally aligned 4-KiB region
(a page) of physical address space.

The IOMMU behavior for register accesses where the address is not aligned to
the size of the access, or if the access spans multiple registers, or if the
size of the access is not 4 bytes or 8 bytes, is `UNSPECIFIED`. A 4 byte access
to an IOMMU register must be single-copy atomic. Whether an 8 byte access to an
IOMMU register is single-copy atomic is `UNSPECIFIED`, and such an access may
appear, internally to the IOMMU, as if two separate 4 byte accesses were
performed.

[NOTE]
====
The 8-byte IOMMU registers are defined in such a way that software can perform
two individual 4-byte accesses, or hardware can perform two independent 4-byte
transactions resulting from an 8-byte access, to the high and low halves of the
register, as long as the register semantics, with regard to side-effects, are
respected between the two software accesses, or two hardware transactions,
respectively.
====

The IOMMU registers have little-endian byte order (even for systems where
all harts are big-endian-only).

[NOTE]
====
Big-endian-configured harts that make use of an IOMMU are expected to implement
the `REV8` byte-reversal instruction defined by the Zbb extension. If `REV8` is
not implemented, then endianness conversion may be implemented using a sequence
of instructions.
====

If a register is optional, as determined by the corresponding `capabilities`
register bit being 0, then a read from the memory-mapped register offset of
the register returns 0 and writes to that offset are ignored.

When `HPM` is 1, the `iohpmcycles` and the `iohpmctr1` registers must be present
and be at least 32-bits wide.

At least one method, `MSI` or `WSI`, of generating interrupts from the IOMMU
must be supported.

IOMMU implementations must support the Svnapot standard extension for NAPOT
Translation Contiguity.

[NOTE]
====
Hypervisor may provide an SW emulated IOMMU to allow the guest to manage
the first-stage page tables for fine grained control on memory accessed by guest
controlled devices.

A hypervisor that provides such an emulated IOMMU to the guest may retain
control of the second-stage address translation and clear the `SvNx4` fields of
the emulated `capabilities` register.

A hypervisor that provides such an emulated IOMMU to the guest may retain
control of the MSI page tables used to direct MSIs to guest interrupt files in
an IMSIC or to a memory-resident-interrupt-file and clear the `MSI_FLAT` and
`MSI_MRIF` fields of the emulated `capabilities` register.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `AMO_HWAD`/`AMO_MRIF` bits do not indicate support for device-initiated atomic memory
operations. Support for device-initiated atomic memory operations must be
discovered through other means.
====

[NOTE]
====
The IOMMU is designed to provide a highly modular and extensible set of
capabilities allowing implementations to include only the exact set of
capabilities required for an application. In addition, implementations may add
their own custom extensions to the IOMMU.

The IOMMU must support all the virtual memory extensions that are supported
by any of the harts in the system.

RISC-V platform specifications may mandate a set of IOMMU capabilities
that must be provided by an implementation to be compliant to those
specifications.
====

[[FCTRL]]
=== Features-control register (`fctl`)

This register must be readable in any implementation. An implementation may
allow one or more fields in the register to be writable to support enabling
or disabling the feature controlled by that field.

If software enables or disables a feature when the IOMMU is not OFF
(i.e. when `ddtp.iommu_mode != Off`) then the IOMMU behavior is `UNSPECIFIED`.

If software enables or disables a feature when the IOMMU in-memory queues
are enabled (i.e. `cqcsr.cqon/cqen == 1`, `fqcsr.fqon/cqen == 1`, or
`pqcsr.pqon/pqen == 1`) then the IOMMU behavior is `UNSPECIFIED`.

The device-context is 64-bytes in size if `capabilities.MSI_FLAT` is 1 else it is
32-bytes.

When the `iommu_mode` is `Bare` or `Off`, the `PPN` field is don't-care. When
in `Bare` mode only Untranslated requests are allowed. Translated requests,
Translation request, and PCIe message transactions are unsupported.

All IOMMUs must support `Off` and `Bare` mode. An IOMMU is allowed to support a
subset of directory-table levels and device-context widths. At a minimum one
of the modes must be supported.

When the `iommu_mode` field value is changed to `Off` the IOMMU guarantees that
in-flight transactions from devices connected to the IOMMU will be processed
with the configurations applicable to the old value of the `iommu_mode` field
and that all transactions and previous requests from devices that have already
been processed by the IOMMU be committed to a global ordering point such that
they can be observed by all RISC-V harts, devices, and IOMMUs in the platform.

The IOMMU behavior of writing `iommu_mode` to `1LVL`, `2LVL`, or `3LVL`, when
the previous value of the `iommu_mode` is not `Off` or `Bare` is `UNSPECIFIED`.
To change DDT levels, the IOMMU must first be transitioned to `Bare` or `Off`
state.

<<<

When an IOMMU is transitioned to `Bare` or `Off` state, the IOMMU may retain
information cached from in-memory data structures such as page tables, DDT,
PDT, etc. Software must use suitable invalidation commands to invalidate cached
entries.

In RV32, only the low order 32-bits of the register (22-bit `PPN` and
4-bit `iommu_mode`) need to be written.

The IOMMU behavior on writing `cqb` when `cqcsr.busy` or `cqon` bits are 1 is
`UNSPECIFIED`. The software recommended sequence to change `cqb` is to first
disable the command-queue by clearing `cqen` and wait for both `cqcsr.busy` and
`cqon` to be 0 before changing the `cqb`. The status of bits `31:cqb.LOG2SZ` in
`cqt` following a write to `cqb` is 0 and the bits `cqb.LOG2SZ-1:0` in `cqt`
assume a valid but otherwise `UNSPECIFIED` value.

|===

When `cmd_ill` or `cqmf` is 1 in `cqcsr`, the `cqh` references the command in the
CQ that caused the error. Previous commands may have completed, timed out, or
their execution aborted by the IOMMU.

[NOTE]
====
If software makes the CQ operational again after a `cmd_ill` or `cqmf` error,
then software should resubmit the commands submitted since the last `IOFENCE.C`
that successfully completed.
====

The `cmd_to` bit is set when a `IOFENCE.C` command detects that one or more
previous commands that are specified to have timeouts have timed out but all
other commands previous to the `IOFENCE.C` have completed. When `cmd_to` is 1,
`cqh` references the `IOFENCE.C` command that detected the timeout.

[NOTE]
====
Command-queue being empty does not imply that all commands fetched from the
command-queue have been completed. When the command-queue is requested to be
disabled, an implementation may either complete the already fetched commands
or abort execution of those commands. Software must use an `IOFENCE.C` command
to wait for all previous commands to be committed, if so desired, before
turning off the command-queue.

[[IPSR]]
=== Interrupt pending status register (`ipsr`)
This 32-bit register (RW1C) reports the pending interrupts which require
software service. Each interrupt-pending bit in the register corresponds to
a interrupt source in the IOMMU. The interrupt-pending bit in the register once
set to 1 stays 1 till software clears that interrupt-pending bit by writing 1 to
clear it.

When `fctl.WSI` is 1, the interrupt-pending bit drives the wire selected by
the corresponding `icvec` field to signal an interrupt.

When `fctl.WSI` is 0, the IOMMU signals interrupts using messages. MSI have edge
semantics and an interrupt message is generated when an interrupt-pending bit
transitions from 0 to 1. The address and data for the message are obtained from
the `msi_cfg_tbl` entry selected by the `icvec` field corresponding to the
interrupt-pending bit.

If the conditions to set that bit are still present (See <<IPSR_FIELD>>) or if
they occur after the bit is cleared then that bit transitions again from 0->1.

[[OVF]]
=== Performance-monitoring counter overflow status (`iocountovf`)
The performance-monitoring counter overflow status is a 32-bit read-only
register that contains shadow copies of the OF bits in the `iohpmevt1-31`
registers - where `iocntovf` bit X corresponds to `iohpmevtX` and bit 0
corresponds to the `OF` bit of `iohpmcycles`.

This register enables overflow interrupt handler software to quickly and easily
determine which counter(s) have overflowed.

When the `iohpmcycles` counter is not needed, it is desirable to conditionally

[[CYC]]
=== Performance-monitoring cycles counter (`iohpmcycles`)

|===

The `OF` bit is set when the `iohpmcycles` counter overflows, and remains set 
until cleared by software. Since `iohpmcycles` value is an unsigned value,
overflow is defined as unsigned overflow. Note that there is no loss of
information after an overflow since the counter wraps around and keeps counting
while the sticky `OF` bit remains set.

If the `iohpmcycles` counter overflows when the `OF` bit is zero, then a HPM 
Counter Overflow interrupt is generated by setting `ipsr.pmip` bit to 1. If
the `OF` bit is already one, then no interrupt request is generated. Consequently
the `OF` bit also functions as a count overflow interrupt disable for the
`iohpmcycles`.

=== Performance-monitoring event selectors (`iohpmevt1-31`)
These performance-monitoring event registers are 64-bit RW registers. When a
transaction processed by the IOMMU causes an event that is programmed to count
in a counter then the counter is incremented. In addition to matching events,
the event selector may be programmed with additional filters based on
`device_id`, `process_id`, `GSCID`, and `PSCID` such that the counter is
incremented conditionally based on the transaction matching these additional
filters. When such `device_id` based filtering is used, the match may be
configured to be a precise match or a partial match. A partial match allows
transactions with a range of IDs to be counted by the counter.

When filtering by `device_id` or `GSCID` is selected and the event supports
ID based filtering, the DMASK field can be used to configure a partial match.
When DMASK is set to 1, partial matching of the `DID_GSCID` is performed for
the transaction. The lower bits of the `DID_GSCID` all the way to the first
low order 0 bit (including the 0 bit position itself) are masked.

When the programmed `IDT` setting is not supported for an event then the
associated counter does not increment.

The `OF` bit is set when the corresponding `iohpmctr1-31` counter overflows,
and remains set until cleared by software. Since `iohpmctr1-31` values are
unsigned values, overflow is defined as unsigned overflow. Note that there is no
loss of information after an overflow since the counter wraps around and keeps
counting while the sticky `OF` bit remains set.

If a `iohpmctr1-31` counter overflows when the associated `OF` bit is zero, then
a HPM Counter Overflow interrupt is generated by setting `ipsr.pmip` bit to 1. If
the `OF` bit is already one, then no interrupt request is generated. Consequently
the `OF` bit also functions as a count overflow interrupt disable for the
associated `iohpmctr1-31`.

[NOTE]
====
There are not separate overflow status and overflow interrupt enable bits. In
practice, enabling overflow interrupt generation (by clearing the `OF` bit) is
done in conjunction with initializing the counter to a starting value. Once a
counter has overflowed, it and the `OF` bit must be reinitialized before
another overflow interrupt can be generated.
====

[NOTE]
====
In RV32, memory-mapped writes to `iohpmevt1-31` modify only one 32-bit part of
the register. The following sequence may be used to update the register without
counting events spuriously due to the intermediate value of the register:

* Write the low order 32-bits to set `eventID` to 0.
* Write the high order 32-bits with the new desired values.
* Write the low order 32-bits the new desired values, including that of the
  `eventID` field.

Alternatively, the counter may first be inhibited such that no events count
during the update and the inhibit removed after the register has been programmed
with the desired value.
====

<<<

[NOTE]
====
If `capabilities.HPM` is 1 then a minimum of one programmable event counter
besides the cycles counter is required to comply with this specification. One
counter may be used in a time multiplexed manner to sample events but such
analysis may take longer to complete. The IOMMU, unlike the CPU MMU, services
multiple streams of IO and the HPM may be used by a performance analyst to
analyze one or more of those streams concurrently. Typically, a performance
analyst may require four programmable counters to count events for an IO
stream. To support concurrent analysis of at least two streams of IO it is
recommended to support seven programmable counters.

[NOTE]
====
An IOMMU implementation is not required to report a superpage translation
or support reporting all possible superpage sizes. An implementation is
allowed to report a 4 KiB translation corresponding to the requested
`vpn` or report a translation size that is smaller than the superpage
size configured in the page tables.
====

[[ICVEC]]
=== Interrupt-cause-to-vector register (`icvec`)

Interrupt-cause-to-vector register maps a cause to a vector.  All causes can
be mapped to the same vector or a cause can be given a unique vector.

The vector is used:

. By an IOMMU that generates interrupts as MSIs, to index into MSI
  configuration table (`msi_cfg_tbl`) to determine the MSI to generate. An
  IOMMU is capable of generating interrupts as a MSI if `capabilities.IGS==MSI`
  or if `capabilities.IGS==BOTH`. When `capabilities.IGS==BOTH` the IOMMU may be
  configured to generate interrupts as MSI by setting `fctl.WSI` to 0.
. By an IOMMU that generates WSI, to determine the wire
  to signal the interrupt. An IOMMU is capable of generating wire-signaled-
  interrupts if `capabilities.IGS==WSI` or if `capabilities.IGS==BOTH`. When
  `capabilities.IGS==BOTH` the IOMMU may be configured to generate wire-signaled-
  interrupts by setting `fctl.WSI` to 1.

If an implementation only supports a single vector then all bits of this
register may be hardwired to 0 (WARL). Likewise if only two vectors are
supported then only bit 0 for each cause could be writable.

[[MSI]]
=== MSI configuration table (`msi_cfg_tbl`)
An IOMMU that supports generating IOMMU-originated interrupts
(i.e., `capabilities.IGS == MSI` or `capabilities.IGS == BOTH`) as MSIs
implements a MSI configuration table that is indexed by the vector from `icvec`
to determine a MSI table entry. Each MSI table entry for interrupt vector `x`
has three registers `msi_addr_x`, `msi_data_x`, and `msi_vec_ctl_x`. These
registers are hardwired to 0 if `capabilities.IGS == WSI`.

<<<

If an access fault is detected on a MSI write using `msi_addr_x`, then the IOMMU
reports a "IOMMU MSI write access fault" (cause 273) fault, with `TTYP` set to 0
and `iotval` set to the value of `msi_addr_x`.
